# NTU Vote Authentication MINI

Dat authentication service implemented with [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/) (eventually).

2. Upload the scripts using [Clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp).
3. Setup the spreadsheet as the database.
4. Edit the configuration file.
5. Deploy.

## TODOs

- Restrict the number of available session per station.
- Panel for the commissioners (basically Muggles) to manage sessions.
- Re-write the messages in proper English and Mandarin.
